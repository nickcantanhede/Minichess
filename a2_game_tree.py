        """Insert the given sequence of moves into this tree.

        The inserted moves form a chain of descendants, where:
            - moves[0] is a child of this tree's root
            - moves[1] is a child of moves[0]
            - moves[2] is a child of moves[1]
            - etc.

        Do not create duplicate moves that share the same parent; for example, if moves[0] is
        already a child of this tree's root, you should recurse into that existing subtree rather
        than create a new subtree with moves[0].
        But if moves[0] is not a child of this tree's root, create a new subtree for it
        and append it to the existing list of subtrees.

        Implementation Notes:
            - Your implementation must use recursion, and NOT use any loops to "go down" the tree.
            - Your implementation must have a worst-case running time of Theta(m + n) time,
              where m is the length of moves and n is the size of this tree.
              This means you shouldn't use list slicing to access the "rest" of the list of moves,
              like in Tutorial 4. Instead, you can use one of the following approaches:

              i) Use a recursive helper method that takes an extra "current index" argument to
                 keep track of the next move in the list.
              ii) First reverse the list, and then use a recursive helper method that calls
                 `list.pop` on the list of moves. Just make sure the original list isn't changed
                 when the function ends!

        to update self here, not any of its subtrees. (You should *assume* that each
        subtree has the correct white win probability already.)

        Use the following definition for the white win probability of self:
            - if self is a leaf, don't change the white win probability
              (leave the current value alone)
            - if self is not a leaf and self.is_white_move is True, the white win probability
